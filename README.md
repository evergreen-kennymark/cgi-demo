### Intro

This is the demo repo to demonstrate cross language commmunication between c# and Node/Electron. This is possible via the Electron-cgi package installed in both applications

### Running the application

In order to run the application, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then after, cd into the node directory and run `node index.js`;

The Node application will take care of running the C# application.
